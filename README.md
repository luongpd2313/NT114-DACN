# A Study on Transferability of Adversarial Network Flow Against Deep Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System
## Description
This project explores the **transferability of adversarial network traffic** to evade deep learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging [CTGAN](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN), we generate adversarial network flows and evaluate their effectiveness against various deep learning-based IDS models.  
Our study also implements **adversarial training and detection techniques** to mitigate these attacks and enhance IDS robustness.
